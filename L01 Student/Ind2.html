                Lasagna is one of many dishes I consider to be my favorite food. I was watching a cartoon show called "Garfield", 
                a fat orange stripe cat whose favorite food was also lasagna. Watching him devoring the lasagna made me very curious 
                and hungry for lasagna. It was only a few months after that I ate my first lasagna at a restaurant and I was instantly
                 captivated by its taste. As a result, lasagna would become my favorite western food that I would order at any chance I can get.
